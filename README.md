## 🚀 Concept

Generative Manim is a prototype of a web app that uses [GPT-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4) to generate videos with [Manim](https://www.manim.community). The idea behind this project is taking advantage of the power of GPT-4 in programming, the understanding of human language and the animation capabilities of Manim to generate a tool that could be used by anyone to create videos. Regardless of their programming or video editing skills.
