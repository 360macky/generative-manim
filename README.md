## 🚀 Concept

**Generative Manim** (GM) is a suite of tools that allows you to create videos with Manim using LLMs (Large Language Models) like GPT-4 or Claude. The idea is to enable anyone to create wonderful animations from text ✨.

It began as a prototype of a web app that uses [GPT-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4) to generate videos with [Manim](https://www.manim.community). The idea behind this project is taking advantage of the power of LLMs in programming, the understanding of human language and the animation capabilities of Manim to generate a tool that could be used by anyone to create videos. Regardless of their programming or video editing skills.

- 🔬 [Generative Manim API](https://github.com/360macky/generative-manim/tree/main/api): Build over the Animation Processing Interface, or API.
- 🧑‍💻 [Generative Manim Developers](https://discord.gg/HkbYEGybGv): Join our Discord server, learn new things, share your creations and more!
- 🍎 [Generative Manim Streamlit (Legacy)](https://github.com/360macky/generative-manim/tree/main/streamlit): First LLM exploration of LLMs and Animation.

## 💻 Models

**Models** are the core of Generative Manim. A model is a way to convert text to code, that can later be rendered in a video.
