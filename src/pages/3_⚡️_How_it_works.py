Imagine a future where you can watch an animation video from a concept you have in your mind in a few seconds. That could be useful for teachers, students, and more. You won't need to learn how to use a video editor, how to draw, or how to code. You just need to write a text.

That indeed is a future. But it's not that far. We can already start working on it. I have a feel that a pure AI editor like [Runway](https://runwayml.com), or an animation editor like [Jitter](https://jitter.video) could take advantage of a workflow like this.

Storytelling, teaching, and creating it's about to change.




The idea behind *Generative Manim* is test how far we can go with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.

In 2020, (Shreenabh Agrawal)[https://twitter.com/ShreenabhA] did the same with the previous GPT-3.

And there are other users that did the same with that model.

But now, with GPT-3.5, we can do more.
